# VeNo

VeNo started as a pure learning project for C ++ and the understanding of how synths and audio processing work.

The learning project turned into the dream of a new open source synthesizer which offers enough features for newcomers

## GUI-Lang

VeNo use a custom-written Layout language to optimize the relayouting for me

Why selfwritten? because of learning perspective and not happy with pre-solutions

For information look into: DOCS/GUILang.md

## Build

Coming soon

## Generated files

VeNo use File Generatoren written in JavaScript.

The Generator only process "Files" to simplify the changes and use the same-source for the Docs.

GUIFiles for example are simple text files i can also write them direct in the C++ Code but so i can "texteditor support" for some operations
